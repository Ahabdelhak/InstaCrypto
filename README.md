:point_right: The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate :
-----------------
- Android Architecture Components.
- Separation of concerns.
- Test-ability.
- Loose Coupling.
- Applying SOLID principles.
- Using better dependency management Using buildSrc + Kotlin DSL.
- Secure app from reverse engineering and protection against security threats.

:point_right: TO DO:
-----------
- [X] Apply UseCases.
- [X] Apply buildSrc + Kotlin DSL for better dependency management.
- [X] Use Coil for loading images.
- [X] Add some unit tests.
- [ ] Apply MAD score Analysis.
- [ ] Apply ktlint for checking code style.
- [ ] Apply CI|CD and automate some tasks using github actions.
- [ ] Use git hooks to automate code checking and styling before any new commit.
- [ ] Handle Different Build Variants.
- [ ] Add pagination for recyclerview using Paging 3 lib. 
- [ ] Introduce mapper pattern to isolate the logic and making it easier to test and reuse the conversion logic in other classes if necessary.
- [ ] Use JetPack compose for UI .
- [ ] Use Room as a local DB for caching data.
- [ ] Use EncryptedSharedPreferences for securing user data.
- [ ] Secure app from reverse engineering.
- [ ] Apply SafetyNet for protection against security threats.
